    "Q1. Write all the conventions being followed while declaring a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful, giving an idea of what the variable represents.\n",
    "Variable names should start with a lowercase letter, and should not start with a number or contain spaces.\n",
    "If the variable name contains multiple words, use an underscore (_) to separate them. For example, \"my_variable\" instead of \"myVariable\".\n",
    "It is recommended to use all lowercase letters when naming variables.\n",
    "Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names. For example, \"if\" or \"else\" should not be used as variable names.\n",
    "Constants should be written in all capital letters. For example, \"MAX_VALUE\" instead of \"max_value\".\n",
    "When declaring a variable, it is not necessary to specify its data type explicitly, as Python is dynamically typed. However, it is good practice to use a meaningful name and initialize the variable to a sensible value."
